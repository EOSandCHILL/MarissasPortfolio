Who am I:

Hello! I'm Marissa, an IT help desk technician and an Army veteran. I'm proficient in diagnosing and resolving technical issues, providing technical support, and assisting users with computer and software problems. Rooted in discipline from my military background, I bring a detail-oriented approach to ensure efficiency and precision in problem-solving. As a leader, I prioritize effective communication, foster collaboration, and maintain a commitment to creating a positive team environment. My dedication to excellence is evident in guiding my team through challenges and delivering exceptional customer service. Looking forward, I aim to further advance my technical skills, explore leadership opportunities, and contribute to the dynamic field of information technology, leveraging my unique combination of military and IT expertise.

Completed and received two Google Course Certificates: Google Technical Support Fundamentals and Google Computer Networking.
Currently completing Google's I.T. Support Professional Certificate, course 3 of 5, Operating Systems and You: Becoming a Power User. This course will allow me to gain experience with the main components of an operating system and how to perform critical tasks like managing software and users and configuring hardware.
